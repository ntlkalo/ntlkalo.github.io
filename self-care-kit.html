      <h1>DIY Self Care Kit</h1>
      <h3> Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare. ~ Audre Lorde</h3>

<p>  Congratulations! You've decided to make a self care kit for yourself or a loved one. Good on you!
  However, it is strongly encouraged that the self care kit addresses physical, mental, and emotional needs.
  <p> <strong>Physical</strong>: Sometimes we feel icky because we're tired, hungry, or dehydrated. Perhaps we can't summon up the
    energy to address our physical needs, or we just need a quick reminder. Some ideas are sleep aids like a sleeping mask, sleepy time tea, or a pillow spray.
    Or a prompt to drink water, do yoga, or go outside.</p>
    <p> If the issue is physical discomfort, travel sized pain killers, icy hot patches,
and/or a video to self-massage could be just what the doctor ordered.</p>
<p>Personal hygiene items like deorderant, face wipes, or a change of underwear are also popular choices.</p>

  <p><strong>Mental:</strong> We all have bad days where it seems self-evident that we are abysmal failures. When our problem-solving skills
    are focused on tearing ourselves down, we need to meet it with some good old-fashioned logic. <a href = "http://self-compassion.org/wptest/wp-content/uploads/self_compassion_exercise.pdf" target="_blank">self compassion worksheets</a>
are shown to improve mood.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional</strong>: Unfortunatley, we're not purely rational creatures. We know that our bad mood is a dark cloud
    and it too will pass, but it still sucks. So be sure to include some comfort foods and objects to wait out the storm.
    A lot of rainy day favorites (e.g. comic books, books, favorite movies) also work for our inner gray days as well.</p>
    <p>White noise emulators like Rainymood and Coffitivtiy can help your environment feel more calming.</p>
